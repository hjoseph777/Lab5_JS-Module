### Synopsis

The goal of this exercise was to demonstrate the use of JavaScript modules to organize and structure code effectively. By breaking down functionalities into separate modules, we can achieve better code maintainability and reusability. This exercise involved creating and using functions from different modules, and integrating them into a main application file.

### Modules
- [index.html](index.html): The main HTML file that includes the JavaScript modules.
- [app.js](app.js): The main application file that imports and uses functions from various modules.
- [mathModule.js](mathModule.js): Contains mathematical functions such as `add`, `subtract`, and `multiply`.
- [stringModule.js](stringModule.js): Contains string manipulation functions such as `toUpperCase` and `toLowerCase`.
- [arrayModule.js](arrayModule.js): Contains array manipulation functions such as `findMax` and `reverseArray`.


### Example Usage

In the [app.js](app.js) file, we import functions from the different modules and use them to perform various operations. This modular approach helps in keeping the code organized and easy to manage.
